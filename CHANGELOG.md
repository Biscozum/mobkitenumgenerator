## 1.0.0

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
* Removed `default` cases from `switch` statements in the generated `g.dart` file.  
* Made the previously existing `fromJson` and `fromValue` methods in `g.dart` **private**.  
* These methods can no longer be used directly. Instead, you should use **static methods** defined on the enum itself, as shown in the `example`.
